# if686

Documents, assignments and code from the [Computational Languages Paradigms] course at [CIn/UFPE], given by [Prof. Fernando Castor], in the semester of 2015.1.

## Tracking the Learning

The code in this repo is commented as much as possible (and reasonable) to facilitate understanding. Also, the [commits] themselves are commented, often highlighting new things that I have learned.
